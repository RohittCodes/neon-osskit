# Introduction
 
Welcome to Neon OSS Starter Kit! This is a starter kit for building open-source projects with Neon. The goal of this project is to provide a simple, easy-to-use, and well-documented starting point for building open-source projects with Neon.

> It's not the official Neon OSS Starter Kit by Neon, but a community-driven project.

The starter kit comes in two flavors: 
- A Next.js project with Drizzle-ORM and
- A Next.js project with Prisma ORM :)

## Why Neon OSS Starter Kit?

It is a common practice to start a new project by copying and pasting code from a previous project. This is not only time-consuming but also error-prone. The Neon OSS Starter Kit provides a starting point for building your SaaS projects with Neon. It is a well-documented, easy-to-use, and simple starting point for building open-source projects with Neon.
