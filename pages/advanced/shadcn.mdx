# Shadcn/ui

Shadcn/ui is a a collection of re-usable components that you can copy and paste into your apps. It is built with Tailwind CSS, React, TypeScript, and Radix UI.

## Installation

The OSS Kit comes with Shadcn/ui pre-configured, so you don't need to install it separately. You can start using Shadcn/ui components in your Neon application right away.

## Adding Shadcn/ui components

To add Shadcn/ui components to your Neon OSS Kit application, you can run the following command:

```bash
npx shadcn-ui@latest add [component-name]
```

Replace `[component-name]` with the name of the component you want to add. For example, to add a button component, you can run:

```bash
npx shadcn-ui@latest add button
```

This will add the button component to your Neon application. You can now use the button component in your components like this:

```tsx
import { Button } from '@/components/button'

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Button>Click me</Button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

You can find a list of available Shadcn/ui components in the [official documentation](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs).
