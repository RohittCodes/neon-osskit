# Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs. It's a great choice for building modern, responsive web applications.

In this guide, you will learn how to set up Tailwind CSS in your Neon application.

## Setting up Tailwind CSS

The OSS Kit comes with Tailwind CSS pre-configured, so you don't need to install it separately. You can start using Tailwind CSS classes in your components right away.

To customize the Tailwind CSS configuration, you can edit the `tailwind.config.ts` file in the root directory of your project. You can add new colors, fonts, breakpoints, and more to the configuration file.
