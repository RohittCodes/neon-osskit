# Installation

As discussed in the [Introduction](/), the Neon OSS Starter Kit comes in 2 different flavors: **With Prism** and **With Drizzle**. You can choose the one that best fits your project requirements.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- any package manager (npm or yarn or pnpm)

## Scaffold the Neon OSS Starter Kit

To scaffold the Neon OSS Starter Kit, you can run the following command:

```bash
npx @rohittcodes/neon-osskit@latest
```

> Note: This command will create a new next project with Prisma ORM by default.

## With Prisma

To get scaffolded with the Neon OSS Starter Kit with Prisma, you can run the following command:

```bash
npx @rohittcodes/neon-osskit@latest prisma
```

This command will create a new directory called `my-neon-osskit-app` and scaffold the Neon OSS Starter Kit with Prisma in it.

## With Drizzle

To get scaffolded with the Neon OSS Starter Kit with Drizzle, you can run the following command:

```bash
npx @rohittcodes/neon-osskit@latest drizzle
```

This command will create a new directory called `my-neon-osskit-app` and scaffold the Neon OSS Starter Kit with Drizzle in it.

## Further Steps

Once you have scaffolded the Neon OSS Starter Kit, you can navigate to the project directory and start the development server by running the following command:

but before that, make sure you have included the required environment variables in the `.env` file. here is an example of the `.env` file (you can find an `.env.example` file in the root directory of your project):

> Note: Make sure to replace the placeholders with your actual values.

```bash
DATABASE_URL="your-neon-database-url"

NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your-clerk-publishable-key
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your-clerk-secret-key

NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
```

Before running the development server, make sure to generate the Prisma client or Drizzle-ORM client. You can follow the instructions in the [Advanced](/advanced) section to learn more about generating the ORM client.

```bash
cd my-neon-osskit-app
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server and you can access your project at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

That's it! You have successfully installed the Neon OSS Starter Kit on your machine. You can now start building your project using the built-in components and features provided by the starter kit.
