# About

Neon OSS Kit isn't an official project of the Neon project. It's a community-driven project that aims to provide a set of tools and components to help developers build Neon-based applications.

## You can help!

Neon OSS Kit is an open-source project, and we welcome contributions from the community. If you have an idea for a new component, or if you've found a bug, please open an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rohittcodes/neon-osskit).

If you'd like to contribute code, please fork the repository and submit a pull request. We'll review your changes and merge them if they meet our quality standards.

The documentation and the complete codebase are open source and available on GitHub. You can find the documentation at [docs](https://github.com/rohittcodes/neon-sskit) and the codebase is divided into seperate repos for now and will be merged soon.
